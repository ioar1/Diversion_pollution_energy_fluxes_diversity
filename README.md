# Overview
This is the accompanying research data and code for the paper de Guzman et al. (2024) - "Food web energy fluxes, energy transfer efficiency and diversity respond distinctively to pollution and water diversion in rivers" published in Freshwater Biology. DOI: 10.1111/fwb.14215 

A study was conducted to assess the effects of water diversion, pollution and their interaction on stream food webs structure and on ecosystem functioning by selecting 4 streams differing in their water pollution level (in a range from low to moderate pollution) and with a similar water diversion scheme consisting of a low weir.

Six datasets are provided as well as the code used to conduct the main analyses.
